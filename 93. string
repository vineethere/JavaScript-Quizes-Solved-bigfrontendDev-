// Strings in JavaScript are immutable, meaning you cannot change individual characters in a string using index assignment (like a[0] = 'c'). When you do this:

// a[0] = 'c'


// JavaScript silently ignores the operation â€” it doesn't throw an error, but it also doesn't change the string.

// If you want to change the first character, you need to create a new string, for example:
//Solution
// bfe.dev
