const obj = {
  msg: 'BFE',
  foo() {
    console.log(this.msg)
  },
  bar() {
    console.log('dev')
  }
}

obj.foo();
(obj.foo)();
(obj.foo || obj.bar)();


// The expression obj.foo || obj.bar will first try to invoke obj.foo. If foo is undefined or a falsy value, it would fall back to obj.bar.

// Since foo is a valid function, it will be called here. But again, the this context is not bound to obj.

// This has the same effect as the second invocation, so this will refer to the global object (or undefined in strict mode).
