class MyArray extends Uint8Array {
  get length() {
    return 3
  }
}

const arr1 = new MyArray(10)
console.log(arr1.length)

const arr2 = new Uint8Array(10)
console.log(arr2.length)

// Code Explanation:

// Class Definition:

// You're creating a class MyArray that extends Uint8Array.

// In MyArray, you've defined a getter for the length property that always returns 3, no matter what the length of the array is. This is because the getter overrides the inherited length property of Uint8Array.

// Creating Instances:

// arr1 is an instance of MyArray with an initial size of 10. But due to the getter, the length of arr1 will always return 3, regardless of the actual size.

// arr2 is an instance of Uint8Array, which has its own native behavior. The length here will be 10, as specified when it was created.

// Solutiuobn 
// 3
// 10
