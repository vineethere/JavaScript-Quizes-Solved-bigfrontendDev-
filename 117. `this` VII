ðŸ‘€ First line: B.log()

This is a static method.

Inside it: console.log(this.dev)

this is the class B, so:

this.dev === B.dev


Where does B.dev come from?

Since B extends A, and A has static dev = 'BFE', B inherits that unless overridden.

So B.dev === 'BFE'.

ðŸŸ¢ Output:

BFE

ðŸ‘€ Second line: new B().log()

This creates an instance of class B, which inherits from A.

log() is an instance method: console.log(this.dev)

this refers to the instance of B.

What does this.dev refer to?

Inside the instance, the property dev = 'bigfrontend' is set from class A.
