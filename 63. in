const obj = {
  foo: 'bar'
}

console.log('foo' in obj)
console.log(['foo'] in obj)






















true
true
Explanation:

console.log('foo' in obj)

The in operator checks if the key 'foo' exists in the object obj.

Since the obj has a property foo, the output will be true.

console.log(['foo'] in obj)

In this case, the expression checks if the key ['foo'] exists in obj.

Arrays are automatically converted to strings in JavaScript, so ['foo'] becomes the string 'foo'. This means itâ€™s checking if 'foo' exists as a property in obj.

Since the property foo is present in the object, the output will be true as well.
